Shuup 0.5.1 Release Notes
=========================

Released on 2016-10-12 09:30pm -0800.

Introduce admin wizard for initializing the shop. This means that the
`shuup_init` management command will no longer generate all the necessary
objects for enabled shop by default.

Add order comment section for admins.

Add options to filter category view with category, manufacturer, price or
variation values. Also enable option to sort by date created and changing
the limit of products shown in one page. In case of custom themes this will
not be available automatically.

Change the way product order boxes are being rendered in front. This
causes backwards incompatibility with custom themes.

Add customer information dashboard for front. This way the end customer
can manage his/hers customer details all from one dashboard. Like the
previous front changes this will also cause some issues with custom
themes. Also Personal Order history: URL has now been changed from
``/orders`` to ``/order-history`` in case this is hardcoded for example
in some email notification please adjust accordingly.

For all changes see the full changelog:
