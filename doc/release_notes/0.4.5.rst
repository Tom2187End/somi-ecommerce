Shuup 0.4.5 Release Notes
=========================

Released on 2016-09-04 14:45pm -0800.

Smaller version release with mostly bug fixes and small
enhancements for existing features.

Most notably fixes for multi language support. Translation should
now fallback based on django-parler settings. Old instances with old
translated objects is not migrated. Main issue with translations was
generating empty values for every language even if the language weren't
translated.
