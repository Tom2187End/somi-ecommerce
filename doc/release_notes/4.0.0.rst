Updating from 3.0
-----------------

Shuup 4.0 introduces many API changes which could affect projects or
addons based on Shuup 3.0.  Here is a list of the API changes and
instructions how to update your code.

* Database changes

  Database migration from 3.0.0 should go smoothly with MySQL and SQLite
  databases.  Unfortunately we don't test with PostgreSQL currently and
  found out just before the release that our migrations don't work for
  PostgreSQL.  Setting ``connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`` to
  ``False`` (e.g. in your ``manage.py``) may help in that case.

* Payment and shipping service API is refactored

  - This affects payment and shipping method addons.
  - See :doc:`../services` document for introduction to the new API.
  - See this `pull request
    <https://github.com/shuup/shuup-checkoutfi/pull/1/files>` as an
    example how to refactor the addon code.

* Simple Pricing is renamed to Customer Group Pricing.

  - Prices have to be migrated manually.

* Enum value ``OrderLineType.CAMPAIGN`` is renamed to ``DISCOUNT``

  - Replace usages of ``CAMPAIGN`` line types with ``DISCOUNT``

* Discount Pricing is removed.

  - Use the new Campaigns features instead.

* ``order_creator_finished`` signal is moved from Front to Core

  - Update your imports.
