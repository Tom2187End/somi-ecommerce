Shuup 0.4.6 Release Notes
=========================

Released on 2016-09-11 8:00pm -0800.

This version is packed with new features again.

Regions
~~~~~~~

Regions are now easily selectable in frontend and
in admin and are properly shown for countries using them.

Importer
~~~~~~~~

Importer is added to allow merchants easily import
csv and excel files. Product and customer importers
are now available and more will be added later.

Carousel
~~~~~~~~

Carousel is now part of Shuup. The reason this was moved
into the base distribution was because it's so heavily
used it makes no sense to have it in separate addon.

**Note!** Instances using shuup-carousel addon should be updated to use
this new app. There is no migration tools for old carousel and the old
carousels and slides needs to be copied manually to new app before
removing shuup-carousel addon from installed apps.

Bigger fixes include a fix to the way pricing is being handled in
Shuup. We also unified the address forms.

For all changes see the full changelog:
:doc:`../shoop-changelog` or `Git commit log
<https://github.com/shuup/shuup/commits/v0.4.6>`__.
