The Provides system
===================

The Provides system is Shuup's mechanism for discovering and loading
components, both first-party and third-party.  Shuup apps use
the provides system in various ways.

* The core itself uses Provides for discovering method and supplier modules.
* ``shuup.admin`` uses Provides to load admin modules, form customizations etc.
* ``shuup.front`` uses it for URLconf overrides etc.

The provide categories used by Shuup are listed in :ref:`provide-categories` but you
can also define your own categories as you wish.

.. TODO:: Document the various ways better.

Provides are grouped under different categories, such as ``admin_module``,
``xtheme_plugin``, ``front_urls``, etc.

Declaring Provides
------------------

Shuup uses the Django 1.7+ ``AppConfig`` system to declare provides.

Quite simply, a developer needs only include a dict with provide categories as
the keys and lists of loading specs as values for new provides to be discovered.

.. code-block:: python

   class PigeonAppConfig(AppConfig):

       provides = {
           'service_provider_admin_form': [
               'pigeon.admin_forms:PigeonShippingAdminForm',
           ],
       }

.. note:: Some provides also require the class named by the spec string to include
          an ``identifier`` field. Refer to the implementation guides for particular
          functionalities for details.


Blacklisting Provides
---------------------

Shuup also supports blacklisting unwanted provides. This is useful when one want to disable
some features like shipping and payment methods provided by a single app. This way,
it is easy to select which provides should be loaded by Shuup.
To blacklist provides, you need to set a special Django setting named `SHUUP_PROVIDES_BLACKLIST`:

.. code-block:: python

   SHUUP_PROVIDES_BLACKLIST = {
        'service_provider_admin_form': [
            'pigeon.admin_forms:PigeonShippingAdminForm'
        ]
    }

This will prevent the spec `pigeon.admin_forms:PigeonShippingAdminForm` from category
`service_provider_admin_form` of being loaded.


Using Provides
--------------

Provide management functions are found in the :mod:`shuup.apps.provides` module.

In general, the :obj:`shuup.apps.provides.get_provide_objects` method is your most useful
entry point.

List of objects that have provides key as attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some objects have attributes that contain a provide key which are used to load provides dunamically.
They are specially used in mixins when they can be attached to some class which overrides the attribute
with its own provide key name, making it easier to extend provides related to class. Here is the list
of objects that have this attribute which can be overrided on a specialization:

``FormPartsViewMixin.form_part_class_provide_key``
    Adds form parts to a view dynamically. Each view will have a custom provide key value.

``View.toolbar_buttons_provider_key``
    Adds buttons to a view's toolbar. Each view will have a custom provide key value.
    Only views that use toolbars can use this attribute, as in ``PicotableViewMixin``.
    Check `~shuup.admin.modules.categories.views.list.CategoryListView` for an example.
