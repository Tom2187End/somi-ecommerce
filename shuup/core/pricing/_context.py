    Object that is or can be converted to a pricing context.

    Currently there exists two kind of `PricingContextable` objects:
    `PricingContext`(and its subclasses) and `HttpRequest`.

    .. note::

       Expression ``isinstance(request, PricingContextable)`` will
       return True for a ``request`` which is `HttpRequest`, because
       `HttpRequest` is registered as a subclass of this abstract base
       class.

    This abstract base class is just a helper to allow writing simpler
    type specifiers, since we want to allow passing `HttpRequest` as a
    pricing context even though it is not a `PricingContext`.
