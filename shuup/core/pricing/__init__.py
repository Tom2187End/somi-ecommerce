Shuup modular product pricing functionality.

The pricing module in use is declared by the
:obj:`~shuup.core.settings.SHUUP_PRICING_MODULE` setting.  The
default is a pricing module that always prices everything to be free.
The base distribution contains :obj:`shuup.customer_group_pricing`, which is an
useful pricing module for many cases.

To acquire an instance of the current pricing module, use
:func:`get_pricing_module`.

In brief, a pricing module is able to price a product based on a
*context*; what exactly a context contains is determined by the module
in question.  You can construct a context from a request by calling the
module's :func:`~PricingModule.get_context_from_request` method, or
for more advanced uses, when you do not have access to an HTTP request,
:func:`~PricingModule.get_context_from_data`.

After you have acquired the module and a context, you can calculate
prices for a product with the module's
:func:`~PricingModule.get_price_info` method.
(:class:`~shuup.core.models.Product` objects contain the
convenience methods
:func:`~shuup.core.models.Product.get_price_info`,
:func:`~shuup.core.models.Product.get_price`,
and :func:`~shuup.core.models.Product.get_base_price`
which do these steps for you.)

If you have multiple products, it will likely be more efficient --
depending on the implementation of the module -- to use the
:func:`~PricingModule.get_price_infos` method.
