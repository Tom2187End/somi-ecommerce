"""
Utilities for versioned caching and automatic timeout determination.

Versioning works by way of namespaces. Namespaces are the first
colon-separated part of cache keys.

For instance, the cache keys ``price:10``, ``price:20``, and ``price``
all belong to the ``price`` namespace and can be invalidated with
one ``bump_version("price")`` call.

The versions themselves are stored within the cache, within the
``_version`` namespace.  (As an implementation detail, this allows one
to invalidate _all_ versioned keys by bumping the version of
``_version``. Very meta!)
