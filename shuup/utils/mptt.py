def get_cached_trees(queryset):
    """
    Takes a list/queryset of model objects in MPTT left (depth-first) order and
    caches the children and parent on each node. This allows up and down
    traversal through the tree without the need for further queries. Use cases
    include using a recursively included template or arbitrarily traversing
    trees.

    NOTE: nodes _must_ be passed in the correct (depth-first) order. If they aren't,
    a ValueError will be raised.

    Returns a list of top-level nodes. If a single tree was provided in its
    entirety, the list will of course consist of just the tree's root node.

    For filtered querysets, if no ancestors for a node are included in the
    queryset, it will appear in the returned list as a top-level node.

    Aliases to this function are also available:

    ``mptt.templatetags.mptt_tag.cache_tree_children``
       Use for recursive rendering in templates.

    ``mptt.querysets.TreeQuerySet.get_cached_trees``
       Useful for chaining with queries; e.g.,
       `Node.objects.filter(**kwargs).get_cached_trees()`

    FIXME: This method fixed the original `mptt.utils.get_cached_trees` method
    as it doesn't consider filtered querysets that might not contain all tree nodes.
