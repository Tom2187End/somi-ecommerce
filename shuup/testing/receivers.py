    Signal handler for detecting shop product orderability changes

    For projects which purchasable doesn't change based on contact
    or contact group can hide unorderable products from frontend
    by changing the product visibility. By default Shuup shows all
    visible products at front which might not be desired for all
    projects.

    Orderability can depend on contact or contact group only when
    some custom supplier modules are included. In these cases
    the project orderability signal handler has to adapt accordingly.
