#: Spec string for the class used for creating Order from a Basket.
#:
#: This is the easiest way to customize the order creation process
#: without having to override a single URL or touch the ``shuup.front`` code.
SHUUP_BASKET_ORDER_CREATOR_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.basket.order_creator:BasketOrderCreator")

#: Spec string for the Django CBV (or an API-compliant class) for the basket view.
#:
#: This view deals with ``/basket/``.
SHUUP_BASKET_VIEW_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.views.basket:DefaultBasketView")

#: Spec string for the command dispatcher used when products are added/deleted/etc.
#: from the basket.
#:
#: This view deals with commands ``POST``ed to ``/basket/``.
SHUUP_BASKET_COMMAND_DISPATCHER_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.basket.command_dispatcher:BasketCommandDispatcher")

#: Spec string for the update method dispatcher used when the basket is updated (usually
#: on the basket page).
SHUUP_BASKET_UPDATE_METHODS_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.basket.update_methods:BasketUpdateMethods")

#: Spec string for the basket class used in the frontend.
#:
#: This is used to customize the behavior of the basket for a given installation,
#: for instance to modify prices of products based on certain conditions, etc.
SHUUP_BASKET_CLASS_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.basket.objects:BaseBasket")

#: The spec string defining which basket storage class to use for the frontend.
#:
#: Basket storages are responsible for persisting visitor basket state, whether
#: in the database (DatabaseBasketStorage) or directly in the session
#: (DirectSessionBasketStorage).  Custom storage backends could use caches, flat
#: files, etc. if required.
SHUUP_BASKET_STORAGE_CLASS_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.basket.storage:DatabaseBasketStorage")

#: Spec string for the Django CBV (or an API-compliant class) for the checkout view.
#:
#: This is used to customize the behavior of the checkout process; most likely to
#: switch in a view with a different ``phase_specs``.
SHUUP_CHECKOUT_VIEW_SPEC = (
    "shuup.front.views.checkout:DefaultCheckoutView")

#: Whether Shuup uses its own error handlers.
#:
#: If this value is set to ``False`` django defaults are used or the ones specified
#: in ``settings.ROOT_URLCONF`` file.
#:
#: Setting this to ``True`` won't override handlers specified
#: in ``settings.ROOT_URLCONF``.
#:
#: Handled error cases are: 400, 403, 404, and 500
SHUUP_FRONT_INSTALL_ERROR_HANDLERS = True

#: A dictionary defining properties to override the default field properties of the
#: checkout address form. Should map the field name (as a string) to a dictionary
#: containing the overridding Django form field properties, as in the following
#: example which makes the postal code a required field:
#:
#: SHUUP_FRONT_ADDRESS_FIELD_PROPERTIES = {
#:    "postal_code": {"required": True}
#: }
#:
#: It should be noted, however, that overriding some settings (such as making a
#: required field non-required) could create other validation issues.
