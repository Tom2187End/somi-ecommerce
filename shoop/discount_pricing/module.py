Discount Pricing Module

This module handles basic discounts for `ShopProduct`s

If the discounted price is higher than `ShopProduct.default_price`
the latter will be used as price.

Example:
If `ShopProduct.default_price` is set to 50 and discounted
price of 20 is added the product will be sold for 20 from
that point forward.
