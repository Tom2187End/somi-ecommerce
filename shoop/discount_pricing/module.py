Discount Pricing Module.

This module handles basic discounts for products.

If the discounted price is higher than the
`~shoop.core.models.ShopProduct.default_price`, the lower will be used.

Example:

  If ``default_price`` is 50 and discounted price is 20, the effective
  product price will be 20.
