Oops! You don't seem to have Node.js installed, or at the very least
it's not called `node`, as we expect it to be.
""".strip()

DEBIAN_ARGH = """
However, you do have a binary called `nodejs` (version %(version)s),
which strongly implies you may be running Debian or a derivative
thereof, where it's necessary to install the `nodejs-legacy` package to
provide a symlink for `/usr/bin/node`.

So, in short, to continue:
    Run (or ask your administrator to run) `apt-get install nodejs-legacy`.
""".strip()

You need to install Node.js (version 0.12 or newer) to continue.
Please see

We could find Node.js, but NPM, the Node.js Package Manager, is not installed.
This is a strange situation indeed, and we're not quite sure how to resolve it.

However we do need `npm` to continue.
